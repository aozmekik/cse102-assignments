# Homework # 10

# Handed out: 2 : 0 0 pm Saturday May 09, 2018.

# Due: 11:30 pm Friday, May 1 8 , 2018.

# Collaboration Policy: No collaboration is permitted.

# Grading: This homework will be graded on the scale of 100.

# Question ( 10 0 points):

# You have date.txt input file which includes from 1 to 1. 00 0.000 integers.

# 1) (10 points) Write a C programming function which read each line from “data.txt” file.

# 2) ( 6 0 points) Write a C programming function which finds prime numbers in data.txt

# file:

# a) (25 points) Record all these numbers (data.txt) into Linked-List, find and show all prime

```
numbers.
```
# b) (25 points) Record all these numbers (data.txt) into an array and use dynamic memory

```
allocation principle, find and show all prime numbers.
```
# 3) (30 points- each 10 points) Compare the calculation time of question 2. a and question 2. b

```
according to values of data.txt:
```
```
1) Between 1 and 500.
2) Between 1 and 750. 000
3) Between 1 and 1. 000 .000.
```
```
Note: the calculation time is the running time of the program to find all results and then finish.
```
```
Write your calculation time results of questions 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3 of question 2. a and question
```
2. **b** into **output_prime_LiknedList.txt and output_prime_dynamic_array**. **txt, respectively**.

```
Note: Three results should be for each line in both of the output files (questions 3.1, 3.2 and
3.3 ).
Show your all results and screenshots of your running programs in HW 10 .pdf.
```
# 4) (10 points) Calculate the file written time for both of output_prime_LiknedList.txt and

```
output_prime_dynamic_array.txt files for data between 1 and 1.000.000. Show your all
results and screenshots of your running programs in HW1 0 .pdf.
```
```
